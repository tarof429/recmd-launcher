# Package for recmd

## Introduction

This is the packaging for recmd.

# Building

To build recmd, you need go 1.15 and modules.

```bash
$ make clean all
```

# Installing

```bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir recmd
$ cd recmd
$ unzip ../recmd-launcher.zip
```

# Starting

The `recmd` program needs to be started before it can be used. This is because it is a client-server application. 

```bash
$ ./recmd start
```

# Running

The following shows how to add a command and run it in the foreground. The run command also has `-b` option to run commands in the backgruond.

```bash
$ ./recmd list
HASH    COMMAND    DESCRIPTION    DURATION
$ ./recmd add -c "df -h" -d "Disk usage"
Command successfully added.
$ ./recmd list
HASH               COMMAND    DESCRIPTION    DURATION
68e90d0ffb85606    df -h      Disk usage     -
$ ./recmd run 68e90d0ffb85606

You can also install data packs. This lets you imports a collection of premade commands. Below is a data pack to setup Grafana. You may want to delete and recreate the data directory before importing a data pack.

```bash
$ unzip ~/setup-grafana.zip
Archive: setup-grafana.zip
replace conf/recmd_history.json? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: A
  inflating: conf/recmd_history.json
  inflating: data/install_grafana.sh
  inflating: data/setup_grafana.sh
  inflating: data/setup_grafana_service.sh
  inflating: data/setup.sh
  inflating: data/grafana-server
  inflating: data/download_grafana.sh
  inflating: data/defaults.ini
  inflating: data/env.sh

```

To interactively run through all the commands in order, you can use the `walk` command. This command will display the content of the script that will be executed and prompt the user whether to run it or not. If the answer is `N`, the next command will be shown followed by a user prompt, until all commands have been displayed.

```bash
$ ./recmd walk
This operation will walk through all the commands.
The command will only be run if you answer 'y'.
Do you want to continue? (y/N) y
